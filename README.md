This repo is contains the e-commerce app that I demoed for Dev Edmonton Society on June 6th, 2024. 

This is a Ruby on Rails project in addition to the set of Keynote slides that I used. The presentation is in the root directory and labeled "RoR Presentation". 

To run the program, first ensure that both Ruby and Ruby on Rails are installed on your system. 

Then, to migrate the database run "rails db:migrate". 

Once that is done, run "rails s" to start the server. 

Please feel free to contact me if you have any issues.
